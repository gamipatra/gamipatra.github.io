## First time using GitHub
 ![welcome.png]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/welcome.png)
 
### This is my first time using GitHub, and man! It seemed simple yet very complex for someone with no knowledge of code and how it works. After 2 hours of following a youtube tutorial, I think I'm getting the hang of the basics...is there a way for basics for basics? - well.. you get my point. 

### This is a very simple website for the purpose of my Assignment 2! Welcome to my first ever blog! 


**Pro tip:**
- Click "blog" for journal entries!
- Click "about" for some fun facts about me!
